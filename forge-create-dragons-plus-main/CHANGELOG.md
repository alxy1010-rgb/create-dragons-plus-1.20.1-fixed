# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1-mc1.20.1-fix2] - 2026-04-14

**This is a third-party custom fix version** based on **Forge-Create: Dragons Plus v1.0.1 (Unofficial Forge 1.20.1 Port)**.
Modifications made by **Hinakiel**:

### Fixed
- **ClassCastException in Fan Sanding**: Fixed a critical crash where `SandingFanProcessingType` passed a generic `RecipeWrapper` to Create's `SandPaperPolishingRecipe`. Now correctly wraps the stack in `SandPaperInv`.
- **NPE in Bulk Ending**: Fixed a `NullPointerException` during the initialization of Bulk Ending recipes within `PotionMixingRecipesMixin`.

### Added
- **Localization: Supplemented missing translation keys for fluids (including buckets) and fan processing recipe types to resolve raw translation key display issues.

**本修改版**是基于 **Forge-Create: Dragons Plus v1.0.1 (非官方 Forge 1.20.1 移植版)** 的第三方个人修复版本。
修改人：**Hinakiel**

### 修复
- **鼓风机喷砂崩溃**: 修复了 `SandingFanProcessingType` 尝试将 `RecipeWrapper` 强转为 `SandPaperInv` 导致的 `ClassCastException` 炸档问题。
- **批量终结崩溃**: 修复了 `PotionMixingRecipesMixin` 在初始化批量终结配方时可能触发的空指针（NPE）崩溃。

### 新增
- **本地化**: 针对所有流体（及对应流体桶）与鼓风机批量处理配方类型，补全了原版缺失的翻译键，解决了游戏内显示原始代码键名的问题。


## [1.0.1-mc1.20.1-fix1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **[FATAL] Config access during registry freeze**: `FanProcessingTypeMixinForGarnished` called `CDPConfig.server().enableBulkFreezing.get()` during `FanProcessingTypeRegistry.init()`, before config was loaded. Current Forge logs a warning; future versions will crash in production too. Added `isLoaded()` guard with safe default.
- **Mixin SRG/MCP dual-environment compatibility** (6 mixins):
  - `ContraptionMixin`: `@At` target `m_7731_` changed to `setBlock` with `remap = true`
  - `FluidFillingBehaviourMixin`: `@At` target `m_6263_` changed to `playSound` with `remap = true`
  - `OpenEndedPipeMixin`: `@At` target `f_63857_` changed to `ultraWarm` with `remap = true`
  - `AirFlowParticleMixin`: `method` changed to dual-name `{"m_5989_", "tick"}` with `require = 1`
  - `BottleItemMixin`: `method` changed to dual-name `{"m_289173_", "lambda$use$0"}` with `require = 1`
  - These mixins previously only worked in production (SRG names); they now work in both dev (MCP) and production (SRG) environments

### Added
- `CDPRegistryIntegrationTest`: 8 GameTests verifying all 16 dye fluids, Dragon's Breath fluid, Fluid Hatch block, 4 fan processing types, 4 recipe types, DataMap coloring catalysts, config accessibility, and Blaze Upgrade Template registration
- CEI + CIF as `runtimeOnly fg.deobf()` dependencies in build.gradle for three-mod client integration testing
