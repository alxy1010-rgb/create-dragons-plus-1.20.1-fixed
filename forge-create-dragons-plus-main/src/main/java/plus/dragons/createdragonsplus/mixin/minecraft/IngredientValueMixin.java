/**
 * STUB - Not applicable for Forge 1.20.1.
 * <p>
 * In the NeoForge 1.21.1 version, this mixin modifies the {@code Ingredient.Value} codec
 * to support {@code IntegrationIngredient.Value} during datagen. In Forge 1.20.1,
 * {@code Ingredient.Value} uses JSON serialization ({@code serialize()}/{@code fromJson()})
 * rather than {@code MapCodec}, so this mixin has no target to modify.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the conditional mixin library ({@code me.fallenbreath.conditionalmixin})
 * used to restrict this to datagen-only is not available for Forge 1.20.1.
 * <p>
 * If IntegrationIngredient support is needed in the Forge port, it should be implemented
 * by overriding the JSON serialization path instead.
