/**
 * Mixin to implement registry alias support on Forge 1.20.1.
 * <p>
 * NeoForge provides {@code Registry.addAlias()} for remapping old IDs to new ones when
 * loading world data (e.g., fluids stored in pipes/tanks with a deprecated ID). Forge 1.20.1
 * lacks this API, so we intercept {@link MappedRegistry#get(ResourceLocation)} to check
 * the alias table when a lookup returns null.
 * <p>
 * Alias resolution is one-level only: if the aliased ID also doesn't exist, null is returned.
 * This prevents infinite recursion even if aliases are misconfigured.
